# Capstone_Project

I created a capstone project with python using machine learning to help predict future tennis match outcomes by taking data from past years. 
I collected the data from http://tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php. I downloaded spreadsheets that are separated by each of the past 10 years and merged them all into one 
spreadsheet.

To perform the machine learning, I created an algorithm by first reviewing the outcome of each match. The spreadsheets presents the winner and loser of each match. 
Since the outcomes are already known, in order to remove biasness, I created a third column with a binary outcome.
